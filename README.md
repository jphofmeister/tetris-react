tetris game in react to learn react-hooks. Created from following this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGOaCxX8HIU

features of my own that I would like to eventually add:
- the ability to hold pieces
- add a simple algorithm to prevent the likeliness of the same piece appearing twice in a row
